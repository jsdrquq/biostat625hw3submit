This R package fits a multiple linear regression model to specified data using the least squares method. It calculates model coefficients, fitted values, residuals, and provides various statistical measures, including the t-statistic, F-statistic, and R-squared. Additionally, it computes standard errors, confidence intervals, and the covariance matrix of the estimated coefficients.
